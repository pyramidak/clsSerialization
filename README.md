# clsSerialization
You can save your class objects with values to harddisk and load it back. The easiest way to save setting or small database.

Private myObjekt As Object
Sub New(Objekt As Object) 
myObjekt is your basic class holding other properties, in other classes.

WriteXml
Pass filename or MemoryStream where to save the class data from myObjekt.
 
ReadXml
Pass filename or MemoryStream and class data are pass to myObjekt.

I would like to pass on my experience in VB.Net to others and thus support this language for future generations. There are difficult beginnings in any programming language, when you have to learn to use new language libraries so that you can take even the smallest step. I want to help you with that now. You're welcome, signed Zdeněk Jantač.
