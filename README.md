# clsSerialization
You can save your class objects with values to disk and load it back. The easiest way to save setting or small database.

Private myObjekt As Object,
Sub New(Objekt As Object)

myObjekt is your basic class holding other properties, in other classes.

WriteXm : Pass filename or MemoryStream where to save the class data from myObjekt.
 
ReadXml : Pass filename or MemoryStream and class data from disk are pass back to myObjekt.

I would like to pass on my experience in VB.Net to others and thus support this language for future generations. There are difficult beginnings in any programming language, when you have to learn to use new language libraries so that you can take even the smallest step. I want to help you with that now.
